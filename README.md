## vector2d

A simple and convenient 2D vector type without excessive use of external dependencies. If other vector crates are swiss-army knives, vector2d is a spoon; safe, intuitive, and convenient. As an added bonus, you won't run into any excursions with the law using this library thanks to the awfully permissive Unlicense.

## Using vector2d

You probably don't need any documentation to get by with the `Vector2D` type; functions like `dot`, `length`, and `angle` are hopefully all named intuitively enough for you feel them out. If you do find yourself wondering about certain bits of functionality, then be sure to take a look at the [in-code documentation](src/lib.rs), where you can find examples and explanations of everything on offer.
